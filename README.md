# Practical Work 

## Topic 1: Sass Styles and Flexbox based on the BEM Methodology

### Objective
To learn how to design websites using Sass, get familiar with the CSS Flexbox module, and understand the advantages of the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) methodology.

### Overview
In this task, you will be using Sass and Flexbox/Grids to create a pixel-perfect website. The BEM methodology will help you maintain clean and scalable CSS, ensuring that your code is organized and maintainable.

### Requirements:
1. **Starter Project**: Begin by using the provided starter project for this practical work.
2. **Pixel Perfect**: Design the website according to the principle of "Pixel Perfect". To assist with this, install the [PerfectPixel extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi/related) or a similar tool.
3. **Flexbox/Grids**: Use CSS Flexbox and/or CSS Grids for layout management and responsiveness.
4. **Sass/SCSS**: Write styles using Sass or SCSS preprocessor syntax.
5. **Component-based Development**: Follow the BEM methodology for naming classes and organizing components to ensure scalability and maintainability of the code.
6. **Landing Page**: You must code a landing page exactly as designed, pixel by pixel, based on the given template.

## Topic 2: Responsive Web Design (RWD)

### Objective
To develop skills in creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. Learn about fluid design and breakpoints.

### Requirements:
1. **Project Reuse**: Use the project from the previous practical work.
2. **Responsive Design**: Implement a responsive design that adapts to at least two mobile devices: a tablet and a phone.
3. **Relative Units & Media Queries**: Use relative units like percentages or em/rem and media queries to create a flexible, responsive layout.
4. **Technology Stack**: Utilize HTML5, Sass/SCSS, Flexbox and/or Grids, and the BEM methodology to complete this task.

### Tasks:
- **Task 1**: Use the starter project and ensure the webpage is pixel-perfect using tools like PerfectPixel.
- **Task 2**: Implement layouts using CSS Flexbox or Grids, following BEM methodology for class naming and code organization.
- **Task 3**: Convert the website into a responsive layout for tablet and phone using media queries and relative units.
